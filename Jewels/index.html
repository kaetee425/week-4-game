			You generally want to load your javascripts at the bottom of your html body.
			This is because loading in JS is a blocking action which will prevent the rest
			of the html document from being parsed and rendered until after the JS has finished
			loading. Pretty unnoticeable difference with smaller scripts, but as you app code
			grows it becomes much more noticeable.
